# ARCADE SUITE

This is a React application built with **Vite**.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v18 or newer recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

You can check your versions by running:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
Running the Project Locally
Follow these steps to run the app on your local machine:

1. Clone or download the project
If you received the project as a ZIP file, extract it.
If using Git:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
2. Install dependencies
Inside the project folder, run:

bash
Copy code
npm install
This will install all required packages.

3. Start the development server
Run:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
4. Open in browser
After starting, Vite will display a local URL (usually):

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:5173
Open this URL in your browser to view the app.

Building for Production (Optional)
To create a production build:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
The output will be generated in the dist folder.

Notes
If the app does not start, ensure Node.js is installed correctly.

If ports conflict, Vite may choose a different local port.

Contact the developer if environment variables or additional setup are required.
